Passive RGB to VGA bridge
-------------------------

This binding is aimed for entirely passive RGB to VGA bridges that do not
require any configuration.

Required properties:

- compatible: Should be "dumb-vga-bridge"

Optional properties:

- ddc-i2c-bus: phandle to the i2c bus used to communicate with the monitor

Required nodes:

This device has one video port. Its connection is modelled using the OF
graph bindings specified in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/graph.txt. This
connection is meant to be the RGB input bus.


Example
-------

bridge {
        compatible = "dumb-vga-bridge";
        #address-cells = <1>;
        #size-cells = <0>;

        port@0 {
                reg = <0>;
                #address-cells = <1>;
                #size-cells = <0>;

                vga_input: endpoint@0 {
                        reg = <0>;
                        remote-endpoint = <&tcon0_out_vga>;
               };
        };
};
